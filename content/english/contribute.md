## Value 4 Value

I really appreciate you even considering supporting the production of the Volunteer Technologist podcast! This is a Value 4 Value podcast, which means I'll never charge you to listen. The idea behind Value 4 Value is that people who find the show valuable can contribute whatever they feel it's worth. I love making this podcast, and sincerely hope that you find it valuable, but hosting and producing it does cost money. I feel pretty strongly that since I am asking you to help offset some of the costs that I should elaborate on what they are. With that in mind, here's a look at what I'm spending on the show:

|      Vendor      |         Use         |     Cost     |                                                          Notes                                                           |
|:----------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  [Podhome][ph]   |       Hosting       | $15.99/month | This covers the hosting and distribution of the actual audio files, transcripts, show notes, title suggestions, and more |
|  [Podhome][ae]   |  Audio Enhancement  | ~$0.90/month |                                      This makes everything sound better. Each epis                                       |
|    [Gandi][g]    | Domain registration | $17.75/year  |                                   This is what lets me use `volunteertechnologist.com`                                   |
|  [Riverside][r]  |      Recording      |  $19/month   |                          I had to upgrade to a paid tier to continue getting individual tracks                           |
| **Total / year** |                     |   $448.43    |                                                                                                                          |

In addition to these fixed costs, I also spend quite a bit of time preparing for each episode and doing the work to transform the raw interview into a polished end product that, hopefully, you enjoy listening to.

### Boosts âš¡

Another great way to support the show is by sending a boost via [conshax.app/support/volunteertechnologist](https://conshax.app/support/volunteertechnologist) or, even better, with a modern podcast app such as [Fountain][f]. Listening in Fountain will also open up several features you won't find in traditional podcast apps such as chapter markers, transcipts, and many more. You can get Fountain via my referral link at [fountain.fm/genebean?code=5cb3b5f06a][f]

If you'd like to learn more about boosts or any of the other cool features that new podcast apps like Fountain provide, then I highly suggest checking out the excelent post by [Todd Cochrane][t] entitled [Podcasting 2.0 Introduction][p]. Additionally, I encourage you to check out [Podcasting2.org](https://podcasting2.org).
