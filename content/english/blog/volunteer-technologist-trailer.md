  <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the Volunteer Technologist podcast. Many who are technically inclined voluntarily put their skills to use outside of their primary job. My name is Gene, and I am one such a person. By day I take care of networking and servers for a software company and used to do the same in educational environments. By night I handle all the technology needs for my local scout district. I&#39;ve also spent quite a bit of time as a volunteer sound technician and Technology Lead at church. All of this has allowed me to see that a lot happens behind the scenes of our daily lives, and that it&#39;s frequently volunteers doing the work. This podcast is a way for me to pull back the curtain a bit so that others can see it too. I hope you&#39;ll join me on this journey through scouting, church, community groups, fire departments, families, international aid, prison, and more. The technologies used in these volunteer roles might surprise you. You&#39;ll hear about newsletters, websites, networks, sound systems, custom electronics, and anything else that are or those that interview have taken responsibility for. Two common threads you&#39;ll likely find between all of these scenarios are passionate people freely giving their time, and a desire to do a lot for as little money as possible. Please take a moment to follow this podcast in your app of choice so that you don&#39;t miss new episodes. If you haven&#39;t already, now would also be a great time to go to newpodcastapps.com to grab a podcasting 2.0 app such as Fountain. Listening in one of these new apps will allow you to experience several features that aren&#39;t present in the traditional ones. You&#39;re invited to check out volunteertechnologist.com For more information or to get in touch</p>
