<p>RJ Hill joins me to talk about the volunteer work he does with <a href='https://www.engineeredreform.com/'>Engineered
        Reform</a> to help people in, or recently released from, prison, neurodiverse individuals, and those working
    through recovery get jobs in the various technology fields so that they can become productive members of
    society.<br /><br /></p>
